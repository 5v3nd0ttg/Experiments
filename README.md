# Experiments

Holds all programming experiments that are stand-alone. The To-Do List holds the status of what I finished and guage what's on my plate to do in the future. It doesn't mean that I won't find something more interesting for my next experiments, but I like to finish things that I started too. The overall purpose of these experiments are small code experiments to help me become familiar with things I haven't had a lot of experience with. All code can be used without my consent, but I'd love to hear from you if something here helped you in a project.
